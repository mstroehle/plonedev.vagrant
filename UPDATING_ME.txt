Updating the Plone Development Vagrant
======================================

This text is for those wishing to update the vagrant to use the latest version of Plone.
It is not meant to help update an installed vagrant running Plone.

You will want to update the version of Plone in:

- version.txt
- Vagrantfile

In `Vagrantfile`, you will be updating the `UI_URL` variable value,
which is the URL where to download the matching Plone Unified Installer.

You will want to add an entry at the top of HISTORY.txt.
